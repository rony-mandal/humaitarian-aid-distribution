# Humanitarian AI Crisis Management System

## 🎯 Project Overview

An advanced **Multi-Agent AI System** for optimizing aid distribution in refugee settlements during humanitarian crises. This system uses multiple specialized AI agents coordinated through an orchestration layer to make intelligent decisions about resource allocation, logistics planning, and delivery optimization.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Four specialized AI agents working collaboratively
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Intelligent prioritization and resource optimization
- **Route Optimization**: Efficient delivery planning considering real-world constraints
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous monitoring and improvement recommendations
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Comprehensive dashboards and analytics

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Agent System Components

1. **Needs Assessment Agent**
   - Analyzes settlement zones and calculates priority scores
   - Considers vulnerable populations, resource shortages, and urgency
   - Identifies critical needs across all zones

2. **Resource Allocation Agent**
   - Optimizes distribution of limited resources
   - Ensures highest-priority zones receive aid first
   - Balances efficiency with equity

3. **Logistics Coordinator Agent**
   - Plans optimal delivery routes
   - Considers road conditions, distance, and accessibility
   - Minimizes delivery time while maximizing coverage

4. **Monitor & Adaptation Agent**
   - Tracks delivery outcomes
   - Identifies bottlenecks and challenges
   - Provides recommendations for future cycles

### Orchestration Layer

The central orchestrator coordinates all agents, manages data flow, and ensures seamless execution of distribution cycles.

```bash
python main.py
```

Test the settlement simulator:
```bash
python data/settlement_data.py
```

Test needs assessment agent:
```bash
python agents/needs_assessment.py
```

These contain complete data including:
- Settlement zone information
- Priority assessments
- Resource allocations
- Delivery routes and schedules
- Actual outcomes and analysis
- Performance metrics

---

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### In `main.py`:
```python
NUM_ZONES = 10              # Number of settlement zones (5-20 recommended)
RESOURCE_SCENARIO = 'normal'  # 'abundant', 'normal', or 'scarce'
MAX_ZONES_PER_CYCLE = 7     # Max zones to serve per cycle
NUM_CYCLES = 1              # Number of cycles to run
```

### Resource Scenarios:

- **abundant**: 150% of normal resources
- **normal**: Standard resource availability
- **scarce**: 60% of normal resources

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: API Key Error

**Error**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found in environment variables`

**Solution**: Ensure `.env` file exists with your API key:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

### Issue: Package Installation Fails

**Solution**: Update pip and try again:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: JSON Decode Error

**Cause**: LLM occasionally returns improperly formatted JSON

**Solution**: The system automatically falls back to rule-based algorithms. Check terminal output for warnings.

### Issue: Visualizations Don't Display

**Solution**: Ensure you have a modern web browser. Try opening HTML files directly in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
